## Description: 
It is very important to keep track of thoughts and ideas as you go and you can't always rely on your memory. That's where this note taker application comes in. Using a server database to store information, you can insert any note title and note body you would like, click save, and your note is officially pushed to and saved in the database to be retrieved later. You can click on saved notes that are listed on the left hand side to view them or you can delete them when they are no longer necessary. Never forget something again!
